# RoboFriends
This project was made while learning and testing the React Javascript Framework.
  
# Running The Project
* Firstly make sure to install the node modules with -> npm i
1. Use ->npm start <- to run this project.  
2. The robots were generated randomly, so just search letters to see a reactive response based on your query
  
# Goal Of The Project
The main reason for doing this project was to get familiar using the React Framework. I focused on aspects of creating components and how using a component over and over dynamically is easier than writing each robot card with its own HTML/CSS/JS.
